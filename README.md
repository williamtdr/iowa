IoWA Training Interface
====
A tool for new and experienced League of Legends players to give them the information needed to get better at the game.

The idea is that if all players understand why they are good or why they are bad at the game, then the whole league community would not be nearly as toxic.  Thus, by giving every player the tools needed to ascertain their shortcomings, those players who would otherwise be toxic to their teammates are much more able to realize why they failed and thus aren't going to blame team members for their own mistakes.

Project Goals:
1.  Give players access to tips based upon their own match history and champion mastery to suit their needs as a player.
2.  Give players recommendations for roles and champions that are similar to the roles and/or champions that they either have a high mastery rating for or have a high win rate with.
3.  Organize a player's mastery data in a visually appealing manner that can help said player interpret their strengths (or just give that player a cool way to represent their skill(s))
4. Provide a nexus by which to give players access to third party websites that can help them learn champions based upon builds of other players or simply just information about the given champion.

Personal Goal:
Obviously, the two of us (williamtdr and Kellvas) like free stuff but those things are rather secondary overall.  Our main intent of this project is to be noticed by riot and possibly become able to work with them on other projects.  For example, Kellvas comes up with champion ideas that are developed up to their full kit and scalings and even goes towards some lore and character development if he likes the idea.


**How do we compare champions?**
----------------------------
Champions are organized in the following manners:
1. Theoretical Meta Roles.  These are the roles on SR which a given champion is most likely to be played from the options: Top, Mid, Jungle, ADC, and Support (e.g. Graves would be considered meta in Jungle, Top, or ADC)
2. Styles.  These are the slightly more specific classifications that tell someone the manner in which a champion is played (e.g. Zed would be an "In-and-Out" assassin because his style aims to go in, kill a target, then get out for free) 
3.  Classification.  These... classifications  refer to the subdivision of attributes of a champion that determine how they play and thus how their styles fit together (e.g.  Garen is a Juggernaut because he is a melee hyper tank with high damage, low ranges and mobility, and minimal CC)
The following tags are used and their definitions follow:
**Juggernaut:** A hypertank with high damage but very low range, mobility, and/or crowd control effects.
**Caster:** A champion whose damage comes primarily from abilities. 
**Marksman:** A ranged champion whose damage comes primarily from basic attacks.
**Duelist:**  A melee champion whose damage comes primarily from basic attacks.
**CC Tank:** A type of tank with large amounts of crowd control abilities.
**Jungler:**  A champion who has a combination of early damage, and sustain, crowd control that allows that champion to abuse thier strengths in the role of Jungler
**Assassin:**  A burst oriented champion or one who excels at abusing opponents without vision.

4. Misc.  These classifications give extraneous information about a champion such as if they are ranged or melee, if they use mana or another resource or no resources, etc (e.g. Riven is a melee champion who is cooldown reliant due to her lack of resources).
The following tags are used and their definitions follow:
**Lane Bully:** A champion whose kit has its strength emphasized in the early game that thus allows it to heavily zone its opposing laner often forcing that player to fall behind.
**Control:** Refers to a champion whose kit allows said champion to create zones that force opponents to move in a specific and/or predictable manner.
**Poke:**  Refers to a champion whose kit has short cooldowns and/or costs and/or abilities that are designed to allow that champion to get free damage on the opponent during laning.  Usually Ranged.
**Melee/Ranged:** Denotes the type of basic attack the champion uses.
**Sustain:** Denotes whether the build or kit of a champion is intended to allow the champion to regenerate resources.
**Burst:**  Refers to a champion whose kit is designed to deal all of its damage in fast combos.  Usually Mage or Assassin.
**Infinite Scaling:** A champion whose kit gives them the opportunity to infinitely scale due a specific mechanic on its kit.
**Early-Mid Game:** A champion whose kit causes their damage or success to fall off significantly by late game due to the nature of their level based scaling or base damage being higher than other champions.
**Late Game:** A champion whose kit forces their damage or success to be weak during early parts of the game making said champion very item reliant in order to scale.
**AD:** Abilities scale with Attack Damage.
**AP:** Abilities scale with Ability Power.
**HP:** Abilities scale with HP.
**Mana:** Abilities scale with Mana.
**MS:** Abilities scale with Movement Speed.
**MR:** Abilities scale with Magic Resist.
